1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

2. Store raw data into hdfs location

3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table

4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" 

5. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format "sales_order_orc"

6. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"


Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

a. Calculatye total sales per year
b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed
c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter
d. In which quarter sales was minimum
e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold



solution:-
# https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv - download dataset

#put dataset into local - fillzila

# cp sales_order_data /tmp/hive_class/  - copy data into /tmp/hive_class/

# create csv table for sales data

create table sales_order_data_csv_v1

# load data local inpath 'file:///tmp/hive_class/sales_order_data' into sales_order_data_csv_v1;
 - load data into created table.

#1> set hive.cli.print.header = true;
    to get column names in selected tables output.

 #2> select year_id, sum(sales) as Total_sales from sales_order_data_csv_v1 group by year_id;
   to get total sales per year.
